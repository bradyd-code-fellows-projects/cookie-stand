# cookie-stand

## Author: [Brady Davenport](github.com/bradydavenport)

This is a project of mine while studying as a student at Code Fellows in Code 201.  The prompt of this project is to help a friend with her 'salmon cookie' business by building a web page that displays metrics regarding numbers of customers in each store location on an hourly basis and cookie output based off of those numbers.  There is also some styling to correlate with the feel of the shops themselves.
